      I'm a 30 year old, web developer from Philadelphia with a deep love for
      beautiful websites. I began my career by obtaining an Associate's degree
      from Strayer University in Information Systems, and later obtaining a
      Bachelor's degree in Software Development from the same University. I've
      also attended NuCamp's Front-End Web Development bootcamp to gain
      expertise in the web development field.

      During the summer between my junior and senior years of high school, I
      went blind from complications with my diabetes. I couldn't afford
      healthcare at the time and went months without my insulin and lost my
      eyesight as a result. About a year and two surgeries later, I was able to
      see again. I'll never forget the sunrise after I unwrapped my eyes and saw
      the world again with a new perspective. Even though my background is in
      software development, I know the important of usability for those with
      visual impairment. While I was in school, my teachers struggled to get
      resources that could help continue my education in a way I could
      understand and struggled everyday.

      I believe that the goal of every website should be to visually stunning
      and easily used and navigated by all. We as society tend to forget our
      most vulnerable, so building a website that can be used by everyone is
      herculean task that I would like to tackle. If you are like me and believe
      as I do, take a look at my work and reach out. Together we could build
      something beautiful!
