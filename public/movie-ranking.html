    <h3>Grave EncountersðŸ‘»</h3>
    <p>
      If you want a pretty scary, but relatively unknown scary movie, try Grave
      Encounter. The story follows a small team of ghost hunters who find
      themselves unable to escape a rundown haunted asylum in Southern Canada.

    <h3>ðŸ¦‡Identity</h3>
    <p>
      This movie terrified me as a child. It's about a bunch of strangers who
      get stuck at a motel during a thunderstorm after the roads become flooded
      in the middle of the Nevada desert. The guest quickly find that some of
      them are being murdered and they need to quickly figure out who the killer
      is before they strike again.

    <h3>The ExorcistðŸŽƒ</h3>
    <p>
      One of the greatest movies of all time follows Reagan who finds herself
      possess by a demon in her UK home. Her mother brings in doctors and priest
      to hopefully save her daughter's life. It truly is one of the best movies
      ever made.
